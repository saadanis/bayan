# Datasets

## Bayan Dataset

Our full (not annotated) in-house dataset consists of 138 questions with 10 answers *(a link to the answer)* each. The extracted links are the top ten results of Google searches for that question. The questions are in Arabic and exclusively in the Islamic fatwa domain.

Our annotated in-house test set consists of 20 questions with 10 answers each. Each question-answer pair is labeled as either direct, related, or irrelevant.

* direct: a direct answer to the question.
* related: not a direct answer, but contains related information.
* irrelevant: if the answer is not related to the topic.

## SEMEVAL Dataset
